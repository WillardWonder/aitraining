      <h1>Flat Cap Co. Email Response Workshop</h1>
      <p>This activity helps you train ChatGPT to match your personal writing style. You'll work through 3 realistic emails—from a coworker, a boss, and a customer—and progressively teach the AI to sound more like you.</p>

      <h2>How to Use This Activity</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Copy each email and paste it into ChatGPT.</li>
        <li>Use the starter prompt to generate a draft response.</li>
        <li>Say: <em>"Actually, I would say something like this..."</em> and type your version.</li>
        <li>Let ChatGPT adjust to match your voice.</li>
        <li>By the third example, the AI should require fewer changes.</li>
        <li>Finally, use: <em>"Based on my edits, create a writing profile that matches my style."</em></li>
      </ol>

Hey!

For the team-building day next week—and the potluck part—what were you bringing again? I know we talked about it at some point but I totally blanked. Just trying to get the list together today. Let me know when you have a sec!

Thanks!!

Just saw your latest version. Not quite what I expected. Maybe rework a little? Something about the tone just isn’t landing. We might need to bring in someone else to punch it up if it doesn’t improve.

I’ll be out this afternoon, but loop me in if you have a strong revision.

Hey there,

I’m not sure what the process is here, but according to tracking, my order was marked as delivered yesterday—but it wasn’t on my porch when I got home. I even checked with neighbors and nothing. This has never happened before and I’m kinda frustrated. It was a gift too. What am I supposed to do in this case?

          <strong>Prompt:</strong> "Write a kind, professional reply acknowledging the missing package, explaining next steps, and showing empathy. Keep the tone supportive and clear."

      <div class="email-section">
        <h2>Bonus: Build Your Writing Profile</h2>
        <p>After completing all three responses, give ChatGPT this prompt:</p>
        <div class="prompt-block">
          <em>"Based on my edits and responses, create a writing profile that captures my tone, structure, and style preferences."</em>
        </div>
        <p>This will help you reuse your tone and voice in future AI-assisted writing tasks.</p>
